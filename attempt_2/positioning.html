    <h1>Absolute Positioning vs Relative Positioning</h1>
    <p>Enabe relative positioning with "positon: relative;" CSS selector. You then have the option for additional selectors: top, bottom, left, right.</p>
    <p>If you set "top: 200px", this means "from the top, push it 200px", so it actually pushes the element down 200px. And so on with the other 3 selectors.</p>

    <p>Enable absolute positioning with the "position: absolute" CSS selector. This will position the element "absolutely" within it's parent element, or rather it's nearest parent that is positioned. In this case, the nearest positioned parent is the body element. </p>

    <p><strong>Definitely review this because it's a little confusing.</strong></p>
