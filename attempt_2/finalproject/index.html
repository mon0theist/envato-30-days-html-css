  <p>It seems that the rest of the course requires a paid ThemeForest theme and Adobe Photoshop, neither of which I want to pay for, so I may not continue the course beyond this point.

  However I have learned/reviewed what I needed to know for Python web scraping (ATBS Chapter 11), which was the original purpose of beginning this course.

  Perhaps if I can get a free theme from ThemeForest and get a trial version of Photoshop, I will complete the last few videos on this course. I'm not necessarily trying to be a web designer but learning this material was fun so who knows.
